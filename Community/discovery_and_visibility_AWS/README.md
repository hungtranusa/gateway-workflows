# Advanced - Manually configuring SQS/CloudWatch Rules

If the AWS user has write permissions to SQS and Cloudwatch then the Enable Visibility after Discovery Option will attempt to create the queue and rule if they don't exist.

If this fails due to the account not having write permissions to those services, please have the administrator configure the AWS SQS FIFO queue and CloudWatch Rule as below

- Create a FIFO SQS queue in your AWS region, called Bluecat.fifo

- Add a message group ID of Bluecat to the SQS queue

- Add a AWS CloudWatch Rule called Bluecat for EC2 event changes which points to the BlueCat SQS FIFO queue
